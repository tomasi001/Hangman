# Hello and Welcome to Hangman!

To play this game all you have to do is:

1. create a directory called Hangman
2. download the contents of this github repository
3. make sure all the files downloaded are present in the Hangman directory.
4. open your terminal and navigate to the Hangman directory
5. type in 'npm start'

## Et Voila! The app should be running on your localhost:3000

# Rules

A random word is presented each time!

Press letters on your keyboard to guess
what letters are in the word!

You get six tries, if you don't guess
the word in six turns you lose!

Good Luck
